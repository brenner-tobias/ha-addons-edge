## About

Home Assistant allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their
add-ons for Home Assistant easily. This repository is one of those repositories,
providing extra Home Assistant add-ons for your installation.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide an add-on to use Cloudflared.
Additional add-ons might follow in the future.
