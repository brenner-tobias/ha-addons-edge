# Home Assistant Add-on: Cloudflared

Cloudflared connects your Home Assistant Instance via a secure tunnel to a domain
or subdomain at Cloudflare. This allows you to expose your Home Assistant
instance and other services to the Internet without opening ports on your router.
Additionally, you can utilize Cloudflare Zero Trust to further secure your
connection.

## Disclaimer

Please make sure you comply with the
[Cloudflare Self-Serve Subscription Agreement][cloudflare-sssa] when using this
add-on. For example [section 2.8][cloudflare-sssa-28] could be breached when
streaming videos (e.g. Plex) or other non-HTML content.

## Initial setup

### Prerequisites

1. A domain name (e.g. example.com) using Cloudflare for DNS. If you don't have
   one see [Domain name and Cloudflare set up](#domain-name-and-cloudflare-set-up).
1. Decide between a local tunnel (managed by the add-on) or a remote tunnel
   (managed in Cloudflare's interface). [Learn more][addon-remote-or-local].
1. This add-on should be [installed][addon-installation] but not started yet.

After completing the prerequisites, proceed below based on the type of tunnel you
chose.

### Local tunnel add-on setup (recommended)

In the following steps a Cloudflare Tunnel will be automatically created by the
add-on to expose your Home Assistant instance.

If you only want to expose other services, you can leave `external_hostname`
empty and set `additional_hosts` as [described below](#configuration).

1. Configure the `http` integration in your Home Assistant config as
   [described below](#configurationyaml)
1. Set `external_hostname` add-on option to the domain/subdomain
   you want to use for remote access e.g. `ha.example.com`
1. Start the add-on (this will overwrite any existing DNS entries matching
   `external_hostname` or `additional_hosts`)
1. Paste the URL from the add-on logs in a new tab to authenticate with Cloudflare
1. Access your Home Assistant via the remote URL without port e.g.
   `https://ha.example.com/`

A tunnel should now be listed in your Cloudflare Teams dashboard.
Please review the additional configuration options below.

### Remote tunnel add-on setup (advanced)

In the following steps you will manually create a Cloudflare Tunnel in the Zero
Trust Dashboard and provide the token to the add-on.

1. Configure the `http` integration in to your Home Assistant config as
   [described below](#configurationyaml)
1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel in the Cloudflare Teams dashboard following
   [this how-to][addon-remote-tunnel]
1. Set `tunnel_token` add-on option to your [tunnel token][create-remote-managed-tunnel]
   (all other configuration will be ignored)
1. Start the add-on, check the logs to confirm everything went as
   expected
1. Access your Home Assistant via the remote URL without port e.g.
   `https://ha.example.com/`

Your tunnel should now be associated with the Cloudflared add-on. Any
configuration changes should be made in the Cloudflare Teams dashboard.

## Configuration

**These configuration options only apply to the local tunnel setup**. More
advanced config can be achieved using the remote tunnel setup.

- [`external_hostname`](#option-external_hostname)
- [`additional_hosts`](#option-additional_hosts)
- [`tunnel_name`](#option-tunnel_name)
- [`catch_all_service`](#option-catch_all_service)
- [`nginx_proxy_manager`](#option-nginx_proxy_manager)
- [`log_level`](#option-log_level)

### Overview: Add-on configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
external_hostname: ha.example.com
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: router.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.1
  - hostname: website.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:8080
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `external_hostname`

Set the `external_hostname` option to the domain name or subdomain that you want
to use to access Home Assistant on.

This is optional, `additional_hosts` can be used instead to only expose other
services.

**Note**: _The tunnel name needs to be unique in your Cloudflare account._

```yaml
external_hostname: ha.example.com
```

### Option: `additional_hosts`

You can use the internal reverse proxy of Cloudflare Tunnel to define additional
hosts next to Home Assistant. That way, you can use the tunnel to also access
other systems like a diskstation, router or anything else.

Like the `external_hostname` option used for Home Assistant, DNS entries will
be automatically created at Cloudflare.

Add the (optional) `disableChunkedEncoding` option to a hostname, to disable
chunked transfer encoding. This is useful if you are running a WSGI server,
like Proxmox for example. Visit [Cloudflare Docs][disablechunkedencoding] for
further information.

Please find below an example entry for three additional hosts:

```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: router.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.1
  - hostname: diskstation.example.com
    service: https://192.168.1.2:5001
  - hostname: website.example.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:8080
    disableChunkedEncoding: true
```

**Note**: _If you delete a hostname from the list, it will not be served
anymore. Nevertheless, you should also manually delete the DNS entry from
Cloudflare since it can not be deleted by the add-on._

### Option: `tunnel_name`

The `tunnel_name` option allows changing the tunnel name to something other
than the default of `homeassistant`.

**Note**: _The tunnel name needs to be unique in your Cloudflare account._

```yaml
tunnel_name: myHomeAssistant
```

### Option: `post_quantum`

If you want Cloudflared to use post-quantum cryptography for the tunnel,
set this flag.

**Note**: _When `post_quantum` is set, cloudflared restricts itself to QUIC
transport for the tunnel connection. This might lead to problems for some users.
Also, it will only allow post-quantum hybrid key exchanges and not fall back to
a non post-quantum connection._

```yaml
post_quantum: true
```

### Option: `catch_all_service`

If you want to forward all requests from any hostnames not defined in the
`external_hostname` or the `additional_hosts`, you can use this option and
define a URL to forward to. For example, this can be used for reverse proxies.

**Note**: _If you want to use the HA add-on [Nginx Proxy Manager][nginx_proxy_manager]
as reverse proxy, you should set the flag `nginx_proxy_manager` ([see
below](#option-nginx_proxy_manager)) and not use this option._

```yaml
catch_all_service: http://192.168.1.100
```

**Note**: _This will still route your defined `external_hostname`to Home Assistant
as well as any potential `additional_hosts` to where you defined in the config.
Any other incoming traffic will be routed to the defined service._

In order to route hostnames through the tunnel, you have to create individual
CNAME records in Cloudflare for all of them, pointing to your `external_hostname`
or directly to the tunnel URL that you can get from the CNAME entry of
`external_hostname`.

Alternatively you can add a [wildcard DNS record](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-proxy-for-everyone/)
in Cloudflare by adding a CNAME record with `*` as name.

### Option: `nginx_proxy_manager`

If you want to use Cloudflare Tunnel with the add-on
[Nginx Proxy Manager][nginx_proxy_manager], you can do so by setting this option.
It will automatically set the catch_all_service to the internal URL of Nginx Proxy
Manager. You do not have to add the option `catch_all_service` to your config (if
you add it anyways, it will be ignored).

```yaml
nginx_proxy_manager: true
```

**Note**: _As with `catch_all_service`, this will still route your defined
`external_hostname`to Home Assistant as well as any potential `additional_hosts`
to where you defined in the config. Any other incoming traffic will be routed
to Nginx Proxy Manager._

In order to route hostnames through the tunnel, you have to create individual
CNAME records in Cloudflare for all of them, pointing to your `external_hostname`
or directly to the tunnel URL that you can get from the CNAME entry of
`external_hostname`.

Alternatively you can add a [wildcard DNS record](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wildcard-proxy-for-everyone/)
in Cloudflare by adding a CNAME record with `*` as name.

Finally, you have to set-up your proxy hosts in Nginx Proxy Manager and forward
them to wherever you like.

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue.

```yaml
log_level: debug
```

Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Home Assistant configuration

### configuration.yaml

Since Home Assistant blocks requests from proxies/reverse proxies, you need to
tell your instance to allow requests from the Cloudflared add-on. The add-on runs
locally, so HA has to trust the docker network. In order to do so, add the
following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml`:

**Note**: _There is no need to adapt anything in these lines since the IP range
of the docker network is always the same._

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 172.30.33.0/24
```

Remember to restart Home Assistant when the configuration is changed.

If you need assistance changing the config, please follow the
[Advanced Configuration Tutorial][advancedconfiguration].
