## About

With this Add-on, you can run [NocoDB][nocodb], an open source Airtable
alternative, on your Home Assistant.

NocoDB works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them
into a smart spreadsheet interface! This allows you to build no-code
applications collaboratively with teams. NocoDB currently works with MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Amazon Aurora & MariaDB databases.
